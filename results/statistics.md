The 95% intervals use 100,000 deterministic task-clustered bootstrap replicates (seed 20260805). Each replicate resamples the 26 task IDs and preserves all four outcomes for each selected task. The 104 task-trial records are not treated as independent Bernoulli observations.

Per-task frequencies are in [per_task_success.csv](per_task_success.csv). Run `python3 results/compute_statistics.py` from the repository root to recompute all outputs.
